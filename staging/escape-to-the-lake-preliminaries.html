        <p>Every year in June, the National MS Society hosts a two-day, 150-mile bicycle ride from just north of Pittsburgh to Lake Erie in Ohio. Nearly two years ago, in June 2007, I borrowed my father&#39;s 20-year-old Univega roadbike, completely unprepared. I used to run crosscountry, but by that point I&#39;d been two years out of practice. I hadn&#39;t been on a bike for any length of time in at least five years, and I really had no idea if 150 miles would even be possible. However, I did manage to find a pair of padded cycling shorts at Dick&#39;s. Of course that would more than make up for a few years of physical inactivity.</p>

        <p>The best thing about <span style="text-decoration:line-through">visiting the President</span> riding the MS150 is the food! Now, since it was all free, and I wasn&#39;t hungry but thirsty, I must&#39;ve drank me fifteen Dr. Peppers.</p>
        
        <p>It&#39;s now February 2009, and the MS150 is coming up again in June. I&#39;ve been on a bike consistently since September, hitting about 10 miles a day between work and school, and the Giant TCR2 is a pretty awesome bike (thank you Soursw. It&#39;s still treating me well). With all these factors combined, I have a feeling it won&#39;t be quite as painful as it was the first time around. But that doesn&#39;t mean I can slack off. I have a few ideas for prep. Firstly: spring break, March 7-15. I&#39;m thinking about riding from DC to Pittsburgh on the newly finished Great Allegheny Passage, a 318-mile bike path converted from abandoned train tracks. Although the entire trail is incredibly flat, it is not graded for road bikes, so I&#39;ll possibly alter the course to avoid flat tires. Stay tuned for updates.</p>
